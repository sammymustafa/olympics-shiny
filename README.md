# Mushroom EDA & Predictive Modeling
#### STAT 301-2 Final Project

Utilized extensive data detailing mushroom characteristics to understand which may be indicative or edible or poisonous properties. Predictor variables including mushroom class, cap shape, cap surface, bruises, odor, gill size, population, habitat, etc. were studied and then utilized into classification models including logistic regression, random forest, boosted tree, and k-Nearest neighbors. The best model was identified and fitted to the testing dataset.
