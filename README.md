# Interactive Olympics Distribution
#### STAT 302 Final Project

Utilized data detailing the distribution of medals won by each country for each sport from the 1976-2008 Summer Olympic Games. The interactive nature of this visualization allows user to select which the year of the games they're interested in as well as whether to hone in on the top sports, countries, or gender distribution of the games. With this design, I hoped to highlight the home-field advantage and greater women involvement over the years, as well as trends in the most popular games at the time.
